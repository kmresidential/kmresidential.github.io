<div class="bq"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/8.png" alt="" title="Kathryn, Richard, &amp; Deb" width="315" height="220" style="float: right"/>House hunting is an exciting but stressful journey with many ups and downs. I can’t imagine a more competent, knowledgeable and sensitive realtor than Kathryn McCowan. She quickly understood our needs and dislikes, found us many good possibilities, buoyed our spirits through several disappointments, and – at a critical time – alertly jumped on a new, desirable listing and facilitated our successful offer. <br/><br/> Kathryn combines a keen understanding of the process, and was unfailingly pleasant to work with.

<div class="bq-float-right">Kathryn shows a genuine interest in her clients.  She paid close attention to detail and guided me through the process.  A pleasure to work with!!

<div class="bq">I started out working with Kathryn through the referral of a friend of a friend. I was simply coming to Boston for a job interview and wanted to look at housing. Kathryn drove us around over the course of two days with no strings attached and no pressure sales. It was like she knew exactly what we were looking for and tailored our search to meet our needs and desires. We found a house that we loved and when we accepted the job offer began negotiations. Kathryn made the process so easy. She knew our bottom line and advocated until we got what we wanted. Kathryn did not stop working after the negotiation of the contract. We kept in touch daily by e-mail.  She worked out issues with my financing agent, the seller, inspector, attorneys and everyone involved. She has an easy going personality and knows how to listen to the buyer’s needs. Best of all she can make it happen. Even after the closing, she has become my source of local information and gives me referrals on restaurants, dentist&#8217;s, a vet, stores and almost anything you need to know when moving to a new location. <br/><br/>Kathryn is THE BEST! She is much more than just a realtor; she is a full package advisor on relocation.

<div class="bq">Kathryn is an excellent realtor. From our first meeting with her, she listened to what we were looking for, and met our needs. She made the whole process easy and painless. Being first time homebuyers, she was always there whenever she was needed to go the extra mile for us, whether it was coming to our home late at night, or even on weekends to sign paper work, or meet with us after hours and answer our questions and put our minds at ease. We would recommend her without question – and definitely plan to contact her when the time comes to sell our home.

<div class="bq">There are endless benefits to having a realtor such as you working for us.  You had our best interest at heart and were our biggest advocate.  At the same time you were rational and vocal and when emotions were flying wild you were able to keep them at bay.  You brought your experience, brains and insight of the real estate industry to the table each and every time we met.  We could reach you any time of the day with our questions and we never felt like we had a dumb question or that we were bothering you.<br/><br/>Looking back we would not have wanted it any other way.  It’s key to have a third party involved.  A separate set of eyes, ears and opinion.  You need someone to guide you and keep you moving in the right direction as well as to help maintain your sanity.  For this we are much obliged to you.</p>
